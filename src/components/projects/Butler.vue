        summary="As Senior Front End Engineer at the Winston Project, I was tasked with building a completely new front-end framework from the ground up. Using Eleventy, Alpine JS, and Tailwind, I built a high-performing framework that integrated with Winston's new CMS. The framework prioritizes accessibility and user experience while still allowing for custom elements per site.<br/>
                <br/>Butler's microsite was the second launch on the new platform, giving content editors and prospective students an improved experience that matched the University's new brand guidelines."
