                I saw an opportunity to add value for clients who had purchased Kasasa's accounts.<br/>
                <br/>By creating a new chart style that
                leveraged existing Bootstrap classes and components and using the same content, the result was a 
                more eye-catching page that highlights the most important account features first."
